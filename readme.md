# To-Do List Application (MERN)

## Description
A simple **To-Do List** application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). This project allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks with a user-friendly interface and efficient backend.

## Features
- **Create** new tasks.
- **Read** (view) existing tasks.
- **Update** tasks (mark them as completed).
- **Delete** tasks.
- **Store data** using MongoDB with Mongoose.
- **RESTful API** using Express.
- **Responsive UI** built with React.
- **CRUD Operations** for managing tasks.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React, JSX, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Others**: CORS, JSON Web Token (JWT) for user authentication (if applicable), Axios for HTTP requests.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed. If not, you can download and install them from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Steps to Run the Project

#### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/khushi1067/to-do-list-MERN-.git
cd to-do-list-MERN-
```

#### 2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend

##### Backend Setup:
Go to the backend directory:
```bash
cd Server
```
Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

##### Frontend Setup:
Go to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd client
```
Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

#### 3. Add MongoDB credentials
Ensure you have a MongoDB Atlas account or a local MongoDB instance. Replace the connection string in the backend code with your own credentials:
```javascript
mongoose.connect('mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority');
```

#### 4. Run the project

To run the backend server:
```bash
cd Server
npm start
```

To run the frontend server:
```bash
cd client
npm start
```

Visit the frontend by going to `http://localhost:3005` in your browser.

## API Endpoints
- **GET `/get`**: Retrieve all tasks.
- **POST `/add`**: Add a new task.
- **PUT `/update/:id`**: Mark a task as completed.
- **DELETE `/delete/:id`**: Delete a task.

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature-name`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-name`).
